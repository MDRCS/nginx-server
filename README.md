### - Troubleshooting nginx
    $ nginx -t # check config files are correct.
    $ sudo lsof -P -n -i :80 -i :443 | grep LISTEN # check port 80 for http and 443 for https are open.
    $ sudo netstat -plan | grep nginx # check processes that are listening.


### - NGINX WebserverSecurity :

    # best practices
    1- keep your OS and Software up-to-date to protect yourself from old vulnerabilities.
    2- restrict access where possible.
    3- use passwords to protect sensitive informations.
    4- use SSL to protect transmissions and identify your site.

    # limit access
    $ vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/wisdompetmed.local.conf
        location /images/ {
            deny all;
        }

    $ nginx -t
    $ systemctl reload nginx

    # you won't get the page.

    # update restricction

    location /images/ {
        allow 192.168.0.0/24;
        allow 10.0.0.0/8;
        deny all;
    }

    $ nginx -t
    $ systemctl reload nginx

    $ vagrant destroy name

### - Establish Authentification to access home page:

    ### Install apache-utils
    $ apt-get install -y apache2-utils

    ### Create a password file outside of root directory for securing locations

    $ htpasswd -b -c /etc/nginx/passwords admin #  -b -c for creating file
    $ chown www-data /etc/nginx/passwords # only be read by root and nginx user
    $ chmod 600 /etc/nginx/passwords

    $ ls -ltr /etc/nginx/passwords # check if permissions has been applied

    # if you want to change password of a user
    $ htpasswd -b -c /etc/nginx/passwords admin
    - deleting password
    - new password

    # add auth in the sectionyou want -> / or /images ..etc

    $ vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/wisdompetmed.local.conf

        location /images/ {
            # Allow the contents of the /image folder to be listed
            autoindex on;
            auth_basic "Authentication is required...";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/passwords; # outside http-root for security reasons
            access_log /var/log/nginx/wisdompetmed.local.images.access.log;
            error_log /var/log/nginx/wisdompetmed.local.images.error.log;
            allow 192.168.0.0/24;
            allow 10.0.0.0/8;
            deny all;
        }

    $ nginx -t
    $ systemctl reload nginx


### - Configure HTTPS :

    # SSL vs TLS
    + SSL can be reversed and it's deprecated.
    + TLS is used for encrypting web traffic.

    $ apt install openssl
    $ openssl req -batch -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx.crt

    # req "request to openssl"
    # -batch "remove the prompts altogether"
    # -x509 "generete a x509 certificate"
    # -nodes "not use DES encryption method"
    # -days 365 "lenth of time this certificate is valid"
    #-newkey "to generate a new key"
    # rsa:2048 "use RSA encryption method 2048-bit key"
    # -keyout "path to store the key"
    # -out "path to the certificate tha openssl wil generate"

    $ ls -ltr /etc/ssl/certs/nginx.crt #check certificat

    $ vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/wisdompetmed.local.conf


        server {
            listen       443 ssl;
            server_name  localhost;

            ssl_certificate      /etc/ssl/certs/nginx.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key  /etc/ssl/private/nginx.key;

            ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:1m;
            ssl_session_timeout  5m;

            ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
            ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

            location / {
                root   /etc/nginx/html/;
                index  index.html index.htm;
            }
           }

        }

    $ nginx -t
    $ systemctl reload nginx

### - Reverse Proxy & Load balancer :

    + Reverse proxy
    - middle man between client and server
    - could handle just one server
    - help implementing SSL, Logs, for web applications
    - compress data so that reduce latency of response.
    - cache data so it can reduce request to a server each time.

    + load balancer :
    - could do all reverse proxy functionnalities but with many servers.

### - Improve performance
    + Enable HTTP/2

    HTTP/2 allows browsers to request files in parallel, greatly improving the speed of delivery.
    You’ll need HTTPS enabled. Edit your browser configuration file, adding http2 to the listen directive,
    then restart NGINX:
        server {
           listen 443 http2 default_server;
           listen [::]:443 http2 default_server;
           #... all other content
        }

    + Enable gzip compression

    gzip compression can greatly decrease the size of files during transmission (sometimes by over 80%).
    Add the following to your server block:
        server {
           #...previous content
           gzip on;
           gzip_types application/javascript image/* text/css;
           gunzip on;
        }

    This will ensure that javascript files, images, and CSS files are always compressed.

    Warning:
    A security vulnerability exists when you enable gzip compression in conjunction with HTTPS that allows
    attackers to decrypt data. For static websites that don’t serve users sensitive data, this is less of an issue,
    but for any site serving sensitive information you should disable compression for those resources.

    + Enable client-side caching
    Some files don’t ever change, or change rarely, so there’s no need to have users re-download the latest version.
    You can set cache control headers to provide hints to browsers to let them know what files they shouldn’t request again.

        server {
           #...after the location / block
           location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico)$ {
               expires 30d;
            }
            location ~* \.(css|js)$ {
               expires 7d;
            }
        }

    Examine how frequently your various file types change, and then set them to expire at appropriate times.
    If .css and .js files change regularly, you should set the expiration to be shorter. If image files like .jpg never
    change, you can set them to expire months from now.

    + Dynamically route subdomains to folders
    If you have subdomains, chances are you don’t want to have to route every subdomain to the right folder.
    It’s a maintenance pain. Instead, create a wildcard server block for it, routing to the folder that matches the name:

        server {
               server_name ~^(www\.)(?<subdomain>.+).jgefroh.com$ ;
               root /var/www/jgefroh.com/$subdomain;
        }
        server {
                server_name ~^(?<subdomain>.+).jgefroh.com$ ;
                root /var/www/jgefroh.com/$subdomain;
        }

    Restart nginx, and you’ll automatically route subdomains to the same-named subfolder.

### - Reverse Proxy - X-Real-IP problem :


![](./static/x-real-ip-solution.png)

    + the problem here is that requests handled by the server come from one ip
      is the the reverse proxy ip

![](./static/x-real-ip-problem.png)

    + The solution should be to allow requests from the real ip

    - Solution
    # go to reverse-proxy server
    $ cd /etc/nginx/conf.d

        server {
            server_name _;

            location / {
                  proxy_pass http://192.168.0.4;
            ->    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            }
        }


    $ nginx -t
    $ systemctl reload nginx

    # go to webserver
    #check logs
    $ cd /var/log/nginx
    $ tail -f access.log

        192.168.0.1 - - [19/May/2020:07:13:47 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 304 0 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.138 Safari/537.36"
        # 192.168.0.1 is not the ip of reverse-proxy but it 's the real ip of the host.


### - Reverse Proxy - Proxy Host Header problem :

![](static/proxy-host-header.png)

    + the problem here is that the server want to get the hostname not just the resource requested.
    # one hostname
    -> Get index.html   X

    # multiple hostnames
    -> Get blog.mdrahali.com/index.html   -> "my name is Mohamed El RAhali"   V
    -> Get stack.mdrahali.com/index.html   -> "hello world"   V

    + if we have multiple hostname for multiple purpose, it's an obligation to forward hostname
      to help webserver figure out what to respond

    NB : if we have one hostname, its not important to config this feature.


    #go to webserver

    $ cd /var/www/example
    $ mkdir example.com

### - Loadbalancer :

    + prerequisites - Vagrant VM:

        1- server-1 -> 192.168.0.6
        2- server-2 -> 192.168.0.4
        3- load-balancer -> 192.168.0.5

    1- server-1 -> 192.168.0.6
    $ cd /var/www/
    $ mkdir example
    $ cd example && echo "server 1" > index.html
    $ cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
    $ vi web.conf
        server {
           server_name _;

           location / {
             root /var/www/example/;
             index index.html;
           }
        }

    $ nginx -t
    $ systemctl reload nginx
    $ curl localhost
        -> server 1

    2- server-2 -> 192.168.0.4
    $ cd /var/www/
    $ mkdir example
    $ cd example && echo "server 2" > index.html
    $ cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
    $ vi web.conf
        server {
           server_name _;

           location / {
             root /var/www/example/;
             index index.html;
           }
        }

    $ nginx -t
    $ systemctl reload nginx
    $ curl localhost
        -> server 2

    3- load-balancer -> 192.168.0.5
    $ cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
    $ vi web.conf
        upstream backend {
            server 192.168.0.4;
            server 192.168.0.6;
            zone backend 64k;
        }

        server {
                server_name mdrahali.com;
                listen 80;
                location / {
                      proxy_pass http://backend;
                      #health_check interval=10 fails=3 passes=2;
               }
        }

    NOTE
    -> `health_check` directive is available as part of nginx commercial subscription.
    -> it ping servers each time with an interval to see if server is down/up.

    # load balancing method implemented here is Round Robin. each server sequentially.

    1- first scenario
    - imagine 2 servers are down, 1 server is up and worker 3 requesting each server to respond to a request
      he will mark server 1,2 as down and get respond from server 3 and serve the client.
      the same scenario will repeat with other workers because each worker has it's own memory

![](./static/worker_memory_problem.png)

    + this is why nginx have a mechanism to configure a shared-memory to optimize this process.
    -> zone backend 64k

![](./static/shared_memory_archiecture.png)

    ++ The zone directive defines a memory zone that is shared among worker processes
       and is used to store the configuration of the server group. This enables the worker
       processes to use the same set of counters to keep track of responses from the servers
       in the group. The zone directive also makes the group dynamically configurable.

       - 64k :
        Setting the Size for the Zone
        There are no exact settings due to quite different usage patterns. Each feature,
        such as sticky cookie/route/learn load balancing, health checks, or re-resolving
        will affect the zone size.

        - For example, the 256 Kb zone with the sticky_route session persistence method and a single health check can hold up to:

            128 servers (adding a single peer by specifying IP:port);
            88 servers (adding a single peer by specifying hostname:port, hostname resolves to single IP);
            12 servers (adding multiple peers by specifying hostname:port, hostname resolves to many IPs).


    # Testing :

    ## Open each proxy location in a browser:
        http://192.168.0.5/roundrobin
        http://192.168.0.5/leastconn
        http://192.168.0.5/iphash
        http://192.168.0.5/weighted

    ## also you can test in terminal
    $ curl mdrahali.com/roundrobin
    $ curl mdrahali.com/leastconn
    $ curl mdrahali.com/iphash
    $ curl mdrahali.com/weighted


### - Health monitoring - active & passive :

    + tip 1 -  i can mark a server as down by :
        upstream backend {
            server 192.168.0.4 down;
            server 192.168.0.6;
            zone backend 64k;
        }

    + tip 2 - passive monitoring :

         upstream backend {
            server 192.168.0.4 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=50;
            server 192.168.0.6;
            zone backend 64k;
        }

        # go to server 1
        $ systemctl stop nginx

        # go to load balancer
        # for i in {1..3}; do curl mdrahali.com

        # go to server 1
        $ systemctl start nginx

        # go to load balancer
        $ curl mdrahali.com
        # you will observe that load-balancer won't request server 1 because he considere it as down fro 50s.

    max_fails=number
    sets the number of unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the server that should happen
    in the duration set by the fail_timeout parameter to consider the server unavailable for a
    duration also set by the fail_timeout parameter. By default, the number of unsuccessful attempts is set to 1.

    fail_timeout=time
    sets
    the time during which the specified number of unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the server
    should happen to consider the server unavailable;
    and the period of time the server will be considered unavailable.
    By default, the parameter is set to 10 seconds.

    + for more options in load-balancers -> http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html


    + tip 3 - active monitoring :

    + health_check directive:
    interval – How often (in seconds) NGINX Plus sends health check requests (default is 5 seconds)
    passes – Number of consecutive health checks the server must respond to to be considered healthy (default is 1)
    fails – Number of consecutive health checks the server must fail to respond to to be considered unhealthy (default is 1)

    server {
        listen       80;
        proxy_pass   backend;
        health_check interval=10 passes=2 fails=3;
    }

        }

### + Other Cache directive :

    - Cache-Control directives#
      The following is a list of the common directives used and configured when using the Cache-Control header.
      See HTTP/1.1 section 14.9 for a further explanation of the directives available.

        Cache-Control: no-cache#
        no-cache uses the ETag header to tell caches that this resource cannot be reused without first checking
        if the resource has changed on the origin server. This means that no-cache will make a trip back to
        the server to ensure the response has not changed and therefore is not required to download the
        resource if that is the case.

        Cache-Control: no-store#
        no-store is similar to no-cache in that the response cannot be cached and re-used, however there is
        one important difference. no-store requires the resource to be requested and downloaded from the
        origin server each time. This is an important feature when dealing with private information.

        Cache-Control: public#
        A response containing the public directive signifies that it is allowed to be cached by any
        intermediate cache. This however is usually not included in responses as other directives already
        signify if the response can be cached (e.g max-age).

        Cache-Control: private#
        The private directive signifies that the response can only be cached by the browser that is accessing the file.
        This disallows any intermediate caches to store the response.

        Cache-Control: max-age=<seconds>#
        This directive tells the browser or intermediary cache how long the response can be used from the time it was requested.
        A max-age of 3600 means that the response can be used for the next 60 minutes before it needs to fetch a new response from the origin server.

        Cache-Control: s-maxage=<seconds>#
        s-maxage is similar to the above mentioned max-age however the "s" stands for shared and is relevant only to CDNs or other intermediary caches.
        This directive overrides the max-age and expires header.

        Cache-Control: no-transform#
        Intermediate proxies sometimes change the format of your images and files in order to improve performance. The no-transform directive
        tells the intermediate proxies not to alter the format or your resources.


### - Connections persistence | Keep Alive :

![](./static/keep-alive.png)

    + The first parameter sets a timeout during which a keep-alive client connection will stay open on the server side.
      The zero value disables keep-alive client connections.

### - Limit_Conn :

    + Limiting the Request Rate
    Rate limiting can be used to prevent DDoS attacks, or prevent upstream servers from being overwhelmed by too many requests at the same time.
    The method is based on the leaky bucket algorithm: requests arrive at the bucket at various rates and leave the bucket at fixed rate.

    Before using rate limiting, you will need to configure global parameters of the “leaky bucket”:

    key - a parameter used to differentiate one client from another, generally a variable
    shared memory zone - the name and size of the zone that keeps states of these keys (the “leaky bucket”)
    rate - the request rate limit specified in requests per second (r/s) or requests per minute (r/m)
    (“leaky bucket draining”). Requests per minute are used to specify a rate less than one request per second.

    # webserver 1
    $ vi web.conf
        add this -> limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;


    $ nginx -t
    $ systemctl reload nginx

    # go to server 2
    $ wget http://192.168.0.6/loadbalancer.png

    # go to server 3
    $ this service is temporarily unavailable.


### - GeoIP :
    + this technique is useful when you have for example DDOS attacks from one country/city you can block all ips of this country/city.


    # go to webserver
    # Setup GeoIP

    # downlaod GeoIP Country from :

                               '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                               '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$gzip_ratio"';

    # add just master to the path
    ->  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log master;

    $ cd conf.d
    $ vi web.conf
    #add this -> access_log /var/log/nginx/example.log;

    $ systemctl reload nginx

    $ cd /var/log/nginx
    $ cat example.log
        127.0.0.1 - - [20/May/2020:07:19:16 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 9 "-" "curl/7.47.0"
        127.0.0.1 - - [20/May/2020:07:19:17 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 9 "-" "curl/7.47.0"
        127.0.0.1 - - [20/May/2020:07:19:18 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 9 "-" "curl/7.47.0"

### - Compression :

    + Compression is a great way to reduce the amount of packets to send to client requesting a resource
      Compression Algorithms could reduce data sent to users by 70% to it enhance speed alot.

    $ vi demo.txt
    $ ls -lh
    $ gzip -9 -c demo.txt > demo.gz
    $ ls -lh

        -rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 2.1K May 20 07:31 demo.gz
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 5.3K May 20 07:31 demo.txt

    - 65% reducing size of data.

    #Add Compression to the server:
    $ vi nginx.conf
        gzip on;
        -> gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
        gzip_disable "msie6";

    $ systemctl reload nginx

    $ cd /var/www/example
    $ vi demo.txt
    #add alot of text

    $ curl mdrahali.com/demo.txt > c1.txt
    $ curl -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" mdrahali.com/demo.txt > c2.txt
    $ ls -lh
    #check sizes of each file.

    # level of compression :

    $ vi nginx.conf
    # add -> gzip_comp_level 9;

    + The level of gzip compression simply determines how compressed the data is on a scale from 1-9,
      where 9 is the most compressed. The trade-off is that the most compressed data usually requires
      the most work to compress/decompress, so if you have it set fairly high on a high-volume website,
      you may feel its effect.

### - Hotlink protection in Nginx

    Hotlinked files can be a major cause for bandwidth leeching for some sites. Here’s how you can hotlink protect
    your images and other file types using a simple location directive in your Nginx configuration file :

    location ~ \.(jpe?g|png|gif)$ {
         valid_referers none blocked mysite.com *.mysite.com;
         if ($invalid_referer) {
            return   403;
        }
    }

    Use the pipe (“|”) to separate file extensions you want to hotlink protect.

    The valid_referers directive contains the list of site for whom hotlinking is allowed. Here is an explanation
    of the parameters for the valid_referers directive :

    none - Matches the requests with no Referrer header.
    blocked - Matches the requests with blocked Referrer header.
    *.mydomain.com - Matches all the sub domains of mydomain.com. Since v0.5.33, * wildcards can be used in the server names.

### - Nginx Firewall :

    + nginx -V check modules of nginx

    -> Setup NAXSI

    Step 1 — Install NGINX && NAXSI

    $ wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.14.0.tar.gz
    $ wget https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi/archive/0.56.tar.gz -O naxsi
    $ tar -xvf nginx-1.14.0.tar.gz
    $ tar -xvf naxsi
    $ cd nginx-1.14.0
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libpcre3-dev libssl-dev
    $ ./configure \
        --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf \
        --add-module=../naxsi-0.56/naxsi_src/ \
        --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log \
        --http-client-body-temp-path=/var/lib/nginx/body \
        --http-fastcgi-temp-path=/var/lib/nginx/fastcgi \
        --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log \
        --http-proxy-temp-path=/var/lib/nginx/proxy \
        --lock-path=/var/lock/nginx.lock \
        --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid \
        --user=www-data \
        --group=www-data \
        --with-http_ssl_module \
        --without-mail_pop3_module \
        --without-mail_smtp_module \
        --without-mail_imap_module \
        --without-http_uwsgi_module \
        --without-http_scgi_module \
        --prefix=/usr

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

    Step 2 — Configuring NAXSI

    $ sudo cp ~/naxsi-0.56/naxsi_config/naxsi_core.rules /etc/nginx/
    $ sudo vi /etc/nginx/naxsi.rules
         SecRulesEnabled;
         DeniedUrl "/error.html";

         ## Check for all the rules
         CheckRule "$SQL >= 8" BLOCK;
         CheckRule "$RFI >= 8" BLOCK;
         CheckRule "$TRAVERSAL >= 4" BLOCK;
         CheckRule "$EVADE >= 4" BLOCK;
         CheckRule "$XSS >= 8" BLOCK;
    $ mkdir /usr/html/
    $ sudo vi /usr/html/error.html
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Blocked By NAXSI</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <div style="text-align: center">
              <h1>Malicious Request</h1>
              <hr>
              <p>This Request Has Been Blocked By NAXSI.</p>
            </div>
          </body>
        </html>
    $ sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        http {
            include       mime.types;
            -> include /etc/nginx/naxsi_core.rules;
            include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
            include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

        location / {
        include /etc/nginx/naxsi.rules;
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

    Step 3 — Creating the Startup Script for Nginx

    $ sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
        [Unit]
        Description=The NGINX HTTP and reverse proxy server
        After=syslog.target network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

        [Service]
        Type=forking
        PIDFile=/run/nginx.pid
        ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t
        ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx
        ExecReload=/usr/sbin/nginx -s reload
        ExecStop=/bin/kill -s QUIT $MAINPID
        PrivateTmp=true

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target

    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/nginx/body
    $ sudo systemctl start nginx

    Step 4 — Testing NAXSI
    $ curl 'http://192.168.0.4/?q="><script>alert(0)</script>'
    This URL includes the XSS script "><script>alert(0)</script> in the q parameter and should be rejected by the server.
    According to the NAXSI rules that you set up earlier, you will be redirected to the error.html file and receive the following response:

        <html>
           <head>
               <title>Blocked By NAXSI</title>
                  </head>
                  <body>
                    <div style="text-align: center">
                      <h1>Malicious Request</h1>
                      <hr>
                      <p>This Request Has Been Blocked By NAXSI.</p>
                    </div>
                  </body>
            </html>

    $ tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

    Next, try another URL request, this time with a malicious SQL Injection query.
    $ curl 'http://192.168.0.4/?q=1" or "1"="1"'

    # same response -> malicious request

    $ tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

### Advanced NGINX plus Recipes :

    1.2 TCP Load Balancing

    + Problem :
    You need to distribute load between two or more TCP servers.

    + Solution :
    Use NGINX’s stream module to load balance over TCP servers using the upstream block:

        stream {
            upstream mysql_read {
                server read1.example.com:3306 weight=5;
                server read2.example.com:3306;
                server 10.10.12.34:3306 backup;
            }

            server {
                listen 3306;
                proxy_pass mysql_read;
            }
        }

    + The server block in this example instructs NGINX to listen on TCP port 3306 and balance
      load between two MySQL database read rep‐ licas, and lists another as a backup that will
      be passed traffic if the primaries are down.


    # + Load Balancing Algorithms :

    - Round robin :
    The default load-balancing method, which distributes requests in order of the list of servers
    in the upstream pool. Weight can be taken into consideration for a weighted round robin,
    which could be used if the capacity of the upstream servers varies.
    The higher the integer value for the weight, the more favored the server will be in the round robin.
    The algorithm behind weight is simply statistical probability of a weighted average.
    Round robin is the default load-balancing algorithm and is used if no other algorithm is specified.

    - Least connections :
    Another load-balancing method provided by NGINX. This method balances load by proxying the current
    request to the upstream server with the least number of open connections proxied through NGINX.
    Least connections, like round robin, also takes weights into account when deciding to which server to send the connection.
    The directive name is least_conn.

    - Least time :
    Available only in NGINX Plus, is akin to least connections in that it proxies to the upstream server
    with the least number of current connections but favors the servers with the lowest aver‐ age response times.
    This method is one of the most sophistica‐ ted load-balancing algorithms out there and fits the need of highly performant web applications.
    This algorithm is a value add over least connections because a small number of connec‐ tions does not necessarily mean
    the quickest response. The directive name is least_time.

    - Generic hash :
    The administrator defines a hash with the given text, variables of the request or runtime,
    or both. NGINX distributes the load amongst the servers by producing a hash for the current
    request and placing it against the upstream servers. This method is very useful when you need more control
    over where requests are sent or determining what upstream server most likely will have the data cached.
    Note that when a server is added or removed from the pool, the hashed requests will be redistributed.
    This algo‐ rithm has an optional parameter, consistent, to minimize the effect of redistribution.
    The directive name is hash.

    - IP hash
    Only supported for HTTP, is the last of the bunch. IP hash uses the client IP address as the hash.
    Slightly different from using the remote variable in a generic hash, this algorithm uses the first
    three octets of an IPv4 address or the entire IPv6 address. This method ensures that clients get proxied
    to the same upstream server as long as that server is available, which is extremely helpful when the session
    state is of concern and not handled by shared memory of the application. This method also takes the weight
    parameter into consideration when distribut‐ ing the hash. The directive name is ip_hash.


    1.4 Connection Limiting

    + Problem :
    You have too much load overwhelming your upstream servers.

    + Solution :
    Use NGINX Plus’s max_conns parameter to limit connections to upstream servers:

    upstream backend {
        zone backends 64k;
        queue 750 timeout=30s;
        server webserver1.example.com max_conns=25;
        server webserver2.example.com max_conns=15;
    }

    -> The connection-limiting feature is currently only available in NGINX Plus.
       This NGINX Plus configuration sets an integer on each upstream server
       that specifies the max number of connections to be handled at any given time.
       If the max number of connections has been reached on each server,
       the request can be placed into the queue for further processing,
       provided the optional queue directive is specified.
       The optional queue directive sets the maximum number of requests that can
       be simultaneously in the queue. A shared mem‐ ory zone is created by use of
       the zone directive.
       The shared memory zone allows NGINX Plus worker processes to share information
       about how many connections are handled by each server and how many requests are queued.

    ++ Optionally, in NGINX Plus, if all upstream servers are at their max_conns limit, NGINX Plus can start to queue
       new connections until resources are freed to handle those connections. Specifying a queue is optional.
       When queuing, we must take into consideration a reasonable queue length. Much like in everyday life,
       users and appli‐ cations would much rather be asked to come back after a short period of time than wait
       in a long line and still not be served. The queue directive in an upstream block specifies the max length of
       the queue. The timeout parameter of the queue directive specifies how long any given request should wait
       in queue before giving up, which defaults to 60 seconds.


    -> Intelligent Session Persistence

    NGINX Plus’s sticky directive alleviates difficulties of server affinity at the traffic controller,
    allowing the application to focus on its core. NGINX tracks session persistence in three ways:
    by creating and tracking its own cookie, detecting when applications prescribe cookies,
    or routing based on runtime variables.

    2.1 Sticky Cookie

    + Problem :
    You need to bind a downstream client to an upstream server.

    + Solution :

    Use the sticky cookie directive to instruct NGINX Plus to create and track a cookie:

        upstream backend {
            server backend1.example.com;
            server backend2.example.com;
            sticky cookie
                           affinity
                           expires=1h
                           domain=.example.com
                           httponly
                           secure
                           path=/;
        }

    This configuration creates and tracks a cookie that ties a down‐ stream client to an upstream server.
    The cookie in this example is named affinity, is set for example.com, persists an hour,
    cannot be consumed client-side, can only be sent over HTTPS, and is valid for all paths.


    Discussion
    Using the cookie parameter on the sticky directive will create a cookie on first request containing
    information about the upstream server. NGINX Plus tracks this cookie, enabling it to continue directing
    subsequent requests to the same server. The first positional parameter to the cookie parameter is the name
    of the cookie to be created and tracked. Other parameters offer additional control informing the browser
    of the appropriate usage, like the expire time, domain, path, and whether the cookie can be consumed
    client-side or if it can be passed over unsecure protocols.


    2.2 Sticky Learn

    + Problem
    You need to bind a downstream client to an upstream server by using an existing cookie.

    + Solution
    Use the sticky learn directive to discover and track cookies that are created by the upstream application:
        upstream backend {
            server backend1.example.com:8080;
            server backend2.example.com:8081;
            sticky learn
                   create=$upstream_cookie_cookiename
                   lookup=$cookie_cookiename
                   zone=client_sessions:2m;
            }

    -> The example instructs NGINX to look for and track sessions by looking for a cookie named COOKIENAME
       in response headers, and looking up existing sessions by looking for the same cookie on request headers.
       This session affinity is stored in a shared memory zone of 2 megabytes that can track approximately 16,000 sessions.
       The name of the cookie will always be application specific. Com‐ monly used cookie names such as jsessionid or phpsessionid
       are typically defaults set within the application or the application server configuration.


    2.4 Connection Draining

        Problem
        You need to gracefully remove servers for maintenance or other rea‐ sons while still serving sessions.

        Solution
        Use the drain parameter through the NGINX Plus API,

        to instruct NGINX to stop sending new connections that are not already tracked:

        $ curl 'http://localhost/upstream_conf\?upstream=backend&id=1&drain=1'

    Discussion
    When session state is stored locally to a server, connections and per‐ sistent sessions must be drained before
    it’s removed from the pool. Draining connections is the process of letting sessions to that server expire natively
    before removing the server from the upstream pool.

    Draining can be configured for a particular server by adding the drain parameter to the server directive.
    When the drain parameter is set, NGINX Plus will stop sending new sessions to this server but will
    allow current sessions to continue being served for the length of their session.


    # + Application-Aware Health Checks

    3.0 Introduction
    For a number of reasons, applications fail. It could be because of network connectivity, server failure,
    or application failure, to name a few. Proxies and load balancers must be smart enough to detect
    fail‐ ure of upstream servers and stop passing traffic to them; otherwise, the client will be waiting,
    only to be delivered a timeout. A way to mitigate service degradation when a server fails is to have
    the proxy check the health of the upstream servers. NGINX offers two differ‐ ent types of health checks:
     passive, available in the open source ver‐ sion; as well as active, available only in NGINX Plus.
     Active health checks on a regular interval will make a connection or request to the upstream server and have
     the ability to verify that the response is correct. Passive health checks monitor the connection or responses
     of the upstream server as clients make the request or connection. You may want to use passive health checks
     to reduce the load of your upstream servers, and you may want to use active health checks to determine
     failure of an upstream server before a client is served a failure.


    3.2 Slow Start

    + Problem :
    Your application needs to ramp up before taking on full production load.

    + Solution :
    Use the slow_start parameter on the server directive to gradually increase
    the number of connections over a specified time as a server is reintroduced to the upstream load-balancing pool:

    upstream {
        zone backend 64k;
        server server1.example.com slow_start=20s;
        server server2.example.com slow_start=15s;
    }

    The server directive configurations will slowly ramp up traffic to the upstream servers after
    they’re reintroduced to the pool. server1 will slowly ramp up its number of connections over 20 seconds,
    and server2 over 15 seconds.

    Discussion
    Slow start is the concept of slowly ramping up the number of requests proxied to a server over a period of time.
    Slow start allows the application to warm up by populating caches, initiating database connections without being
    overwhelmed by connections as soon as it starts. This feature takes effect when a server that has failed health
    checks begins to pass again and re-enters the load-balancing pool.

    3.3 TCP Health Checks

    + Problem :
    You need to check your upstream TCP server for health and remove unhealthy servers from the pool.

    + Solution :
    Use the health_check directive in the server block for an active health check:

    stream {
        server {
                listen       3306;
                proxy_pass   read_backend;
                health_check interval=10 passes=2 fails=3;
        }
    }

    The example monitors the upstream servers actively. The upstream server will be considered unhealthy
    if it fails to respond to three or more TCP connections initiated by NGINX.
    NGINX performs the check every 10 seconds. The server will only be considered healthy after passing two health checks.


    3.4 HTTP Health Checks

    + Problem :
    You need to actively check your upstream HTTP servers for health.

    + Solution :

    Use the health_check directive in a location block:

    http {
            server {
                    ...

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            health_check interval=2s
                            fails=2
                            passes=5
                            uri=/
                            match=welcome;
        }
    }
        # status is 200, content type is "text/html", # and body contains "Welcome to nginx!"

            match welcome {
                        status 200;
                        header Content-Type = text/html;
                        body ~ "Welcome to nginx!";
                }
        }


    This health check configuration for HTTP servers checks the health of the upstream servers by making
    an HTTP request to the URI '/' every two seconds. The upstream servers must pass five consecutive
    health checks to be considered healthy and will be considered unhealthy if they fail two consecutive checks.
    The response from the upstream server must match the defined match block, which defines the status code as 200,
    the header Content-Type value as 'text/ html', and the string "Welcome to nginx!"
    in the response body.

    # + High-Availability Deployment Modes :

    4.1 NGINX HA Mode

    + Problem :
    You need a highly available load-balancing solution.

    + Solution :
    Use NGINX Plus’s HA mode with keepalived by installing the nginx-ha-keepalived
    package from the NGINX Plus repository.

    Discussion
    The NGINX Plus repository includes a package called nginx-ha- keepalived. This package, based on keepalived,
    manages a virtual IP address exposed to the client. Another process is run on the NGINX server
    that ensures that NGINX Plus and the keepalived process are running. Keepalived is a process that
    utilizes the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), sending small messages often referred to
    as heartbeats to the backup server. If the backup server does not receive the heartbeat for
    three consecutive periods, the backup server initiates the failover, moving the virtual IP
    address to itself and becoming the master. The failover capabilities of nginx- ha-keepalived can
    be configured to identify custom failure situations.

    4.2 Load-Balancing Load Balancers with DNS

    + Problem :
        You need to distribute load between two or more NGINX servers.

    + Solution :
        Use DNS to round robin across NGINX servers by adding multiple IP addresses to a DNS A record.

    Discussion
    When running multiple load balancers, you can distribute load via DNS. The A record allows for multiple
    IP addresses to be listed under a single, fully qualified domain name. DNS will automatically round robin
    across all the IPs listed. DNS also offers weighted round robin with weighted records, which works in
    the same way as weighted round robin in NGINX. These techniques work great. However,
    a pitfall can be removing the record when an NGINX server encounters a failure. There are DNS
    providers—Amazon Route53 for one, and Dyn DNS for another— that offer health checks and failover
    with their DNS offering, which alleviates these issues. If using DNS to load balance over NGINX,
    when an NGINX server is marked for removal, it’s best to follow the same protocols that NGINX
    does when removing an upstream server. First, stop sending new connections to it by removing
    its IP from the DNS record, then allow connections to drain before stop‐ ping or shutting down the service.


    + Massively Scalable Content Caching
    5.1 Caching Zones

    + Problem :
    You need to cache content and need to define where the cache is stored.

    + Solution :
    Use the proxy_cache_path directive to define shared memory cache zones and a location for the content:

        proxy_cache_path /var/nginx/cache keys_zone=CACHE:60m
                             levels=1:2
                             inactive=3h
                             max_size=20g;
        proxy_cache CACHE;


    The cache definition example creates a directory for cached respon‐ ses on the filesystem
    at /var/nginx/cache and creates a shared mem‐ ory space named CACHE with 60 megabytes of memory.
    This example sets the directory structure levels, defines the release of cached responses after
    they have not been requested in 3 hours, and defines a maximum size of the cache of 20 gigabytes.
    The proxy_cache directive informs a particular context to use the cache zone. The proxy_cache_path
    is valid in the HTTP context, and the proxy_cache directive is valid in the HTTP, server, and location contexts.

    5.2 Caching Hash Keys

    + Problem :
    You need to control how your content is cached and looked up.

    + Solution :
    Use the proxy_cache_key directive, along with variables to define what constitutes a cache hit or miss:

    proxy_cache_key "$host$request_uri $cookie_user";

    This cache hash key will instruct NGINX to cache pages based on the host and URI being requested,
    as well as a cookie that defines the user. With this you can cache dynamic pages without serving
    content that was generated for a different user.

    -> you can cache dynamic content and map it with a cookie for each user, in that time we have content specific to each user.

    Discussion
    The default proxy_cache_key is "$scheme$proxy_host $request_uri". This default will fit most use cases. The variables used include the scheme,
    HTTP or HTTPS, the proxy_host, where the request is being sent, and the request URI. All together, this reflects the URL that NGINX is proxying
    the request to. You may find that there are many other factors that define a unique request per application, such as request arguments, headers,
    session identifi‐ ers, and so on, to which you’ll want to create your own hash key.1
    Selecting a good hash key is very important and should be thought through with understanding of the application. Selecting a cache key for static
    content is typically pretty straightforward; using the host‐ name and URI will suffice. Selecting a cache key for fairly dynamic content like pages
    for a dashboard application requires more knowl‐ edge around how users interact with the application and the degree of variance between user experiences.
    For security concerns you may not want to present cached data from one user to another without fully understanding the context.
    The proxy_cache_key directive configures the string to be hashed for the cache key. The


    5.3 Cache Bypass

    + Problem :
    You need the ability to bypass the caching.

    + Solution :
    Use the proxy_cache_bypass directive with a nonempty or nonzero value.
    One way to do this is by setting a variable within location blocks
    that you do not want cached to equal 1:

    proxy_cache_bypass $http_cache_bypass;

    The configuration tells NGINX to bypass the cache if the HTTP
    request header named cache_bypass is set to any value that is not 0.

    + use case :
    For many reasons, you may want to bypass the cache. One impor‐ tant reason is troubleshooting and debugging.
    Reproducing issues can be hard if you’re consistently pulling cached pages or if your cache key is specific
    to a user identifier. Having the ability to bypass the cache is vital. Options include but are not limited to
    bypassing cache when a particular cookie, header, or request argument is set. You can also turn off cache
    completely for a given context such as a location block by setting proxy_cache off;.


    5.4 Cache Performance

    + Problem :
    You need to increase performance by caching on the client side.

    + Solution :
    Use client-side cache control headers:

    location ~* \.(css|js)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }

    This location block specifies that the client can cache the content of CSS and JavaScript files.
    The expires directive instructs the client that their cached resource will no longer be valid after one year.
    The add_header directive adds the HTTP response header Cache- Control to the response, with a value of public,
    which allows any caching server along the way to cache the resource. If we specify pri‐ vate, only the client
    is allowed to cache the value.

    Discussion
    Cache performance has to do with many variables, disk speed being high on the list. There are many things within the NGINX
    configu‐ ration you can do to assist with cache performance. One option is to set headers of the response
    in such a way that the client actually caches the response and does not make the request to NGINX at all, but simply serves
    it from its own cache.


    5.5 Purging Problem
    You need to invalidate an object from the cache.
    Solution
    Use NGINX Plus’s purge feature, the proxy_cache_purge directive, and a nonempty or zero value variable:

    map $request_method $purge_method {
        PURGE 1;
        default 0;
    }

    server { ...
            location / {
                ...
                proxy_cache_purge $purge_method;
            }
    }

    + Sophisticated Media Streaming
        6.1 Serving MP4 and FLV
        - Problem :
        You need to stream digital media, originating in MPEG-4 (MP4) or Flash Video (FLV).
        - Solution :
        Designate an HTTP location block as .mp4 or .flv. NGINX will stream the media using progressive downloads
        or HTTP pseudostreaming and support seeking:

            http {
                server {
                ...
                location /videos/ {
                    mp4;
                }

                location ~ \.flv$ {
                    flv;
                }
            }
        }

    - The example location block tells NGINX that files in the videos directory are of MP4 format type and can
       be streamed with progres‐ sive download support. The second location block instructs NGINX that any files ending in .flv
       are of Flash Video format and can be streamed with HTTP pseudostreaming support.

    Discussion
    Streaming video or audio files in NGINX is as simple as a single directive. Progressive download enables the client to initiate
    play‐ back of the media before the file has finished downloading.

    6.2 Streaming with HLS

    + Problem :
    You need to support HTTP live streaming (HLS) for H.264/AAC- encoded content packaged in MP4 files.

    + Solution :
    Utilize NGINX Plus’s HLS module with real-time segmentation, packetization, and multiplexing,
    with control over fragmentation buffering and more, like forwarding HLS arguments:

        location /hls/ {
                hls; # Use the HLS handler to manage requests
                # Serve content from the following location
                alias /var/www/video;
                # HLS parameters
                hls_fragment            4s;
                hls_buffers         10 10m;
                hls_mp4_buffer_size     1m;
                hls_mp4_max_buffer_size 5m;
        }

    + The location block demonstrated directs NGINX to stream HLS media out of the /var/www/video directory,
      fragmenting the media into four-second segments. The number of HLS buffers is set to 10 with a size of 10 megabytes.
      The initial MP4 buffer size is set to one megabyte with a maximum of five megabytes.

    6.4 Bandwidth Limits

    + Problem :
    You need to limit bandwidth to downstream media streaming cli‐ ents without impacting the viewing experience.

    + Solution :
    Utilize NGINX Plus’s bitrate limiting support for MP4 media files:

    location /video/ {
        mp4;
        mp4_limit_rate_after 15s;
        mp4_limit_rate 1.2;
    }

    This configuration allows the downstream client to download for 15 seconds before applying a bitrate limit.
    After 15 seconds, the client is allowed to download media at a rate of 120% of the bitrate, which enables
    the client to always download faster than they play.

    + Advanced Activity Monitoring :
    7.1 NGINX Traffic Monitoring

    + Problem :
      You require in-depth metrics about the traffic flowing through your system.

    + Solution :
      Utilize NGINX Plus’s real-time activity monitoring dashboard:
      server {
            listen 8080;
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
            # Redirect requests for / to /status.html
            location = / {
            return 301 /status.html;
            }

            location = /status.html { }
            # Everything beginning with /status
            # (except for /status.html) is
            # processed by the status handler
            location /status {
                    status;
            }
        }

    - The NGINX Plus configuration serves the NGINX Plus status moni‐ toring dashboard.
      This configuration sets up an HTTP server to lis‐ ten on port 8080, serve content
      out of the /usr/share/nginx/html directory, and redirect / requests to /status.html.
      All other /status requests will be served by the /status location that serves the NGINX Plus status API.

    7.2 The JSON Feed

    + Problem :
    You need API access to the detail metrics provided by the NGINX Plus status dashboard.

    + Solution :
    Utilize the JSON feed provided by NGINX Plus’s status API:

    $ curl "demo.nginx.com/status/upstreams\ /demo-backend/peers/0/responses"
        {
             "1xx":0,
        "2xx":199237,
        "3xx":7404,
        "4xx":104415,
        "5xx":19574,
        "total":330630
        }

    The curl call requests a JSON feed from the NGINX Plus status API for information
    about an upstream HTTP server pool, and in par‐ ticular about the first server in the pool’s responses.

    - This JSON feed enables you to feed the monitoring data into any other number of systems you may be utilizing for monitor‐ ing,
      such as Graphite, Datadog, and Splunk.

    + DevOps On-the-Fly Reconfiguration :

    8.1 The NGINX API

    + Problem :
        You have a dynamic environment and need to reconfigure NGINX on the fly.

    + Solution :
        Configure the NGINX Plus API to enable adding and removing servers through API calls:

        location /upstream_conf {
            upstream_conf;
            allow 10.0.0.0/8; # permit access from private network
            deny all; # deny access from everywhere else
        }
            ...
            upstream backend {
                zone backend 64k;
                state /var/lib/nginx/state/backend.state; ...
            }


        The NGINX Plus configuration enables the upstream configuration API and only allows access from a private network.
        The configura‐ tion of the upstream block defines a shared memory zone named backend of 64 kilobytes.
        The state directive tells NGINX to persist these changes through a restart by saving them to the filesystem.
        Utilize the API to add servers when they come online:

        $ curl 'http://nginx.local/upstream_conf?\add=&upstream=backend&server=10.0.0.42:8080'

        The curl call demonstrated makes a request to NGINX Plus and requests a new server be added to the backend upstream configuration.
        Utilize the NGINX Plus API to list the servers in the upstream pool:
        $ curl 'http://nginx.local/upstream_conf?upstream=backend' server 10.0.0.42:8080; # id=0

        The curl call demonstrated makes a request to NGINX Plus to list all of the servers in the upstream pool named backend.
        Currently we only have the one server that we added in the previous curl call to the API. The list request will show the IP address,
        port, and ID of each server in the pool.
        Use the NGINX Plus API to drain connections from an upstream server, preparing it for a graceful removal from the upstream pool.

        $ curl 'http://nginx.local/upstream_conf?\ upstream=backend&id=0&drain=1'
        server 10.0.0.42:8080; # id=0 draining

        In this curl, we specify arguments for the upstream pool, backend, the ID of the server we wish to drain, 0,
        and set the drain argument to equal 1. We found the ID of the server by listing the servers in the upstream pool in the previous curl command.
        NGINX Plus will begin to drain the connections. This process can take as long as the length of the sessions of the application.


    After all connections have drained, utilize the NGINX Plus API to remove the server from the upstream pool entirely:
    $ curl 'http://nginx.local/upstream_conf?\ upstream=backend&id=0&remove=1'

    -> The curl command passes arguments to the NGINX Plus API to remove server 0 from the upstream pool named backend.
       This API call will return all of the servers and their IDs that are still left in the pool. As we started with an empty pool,
       added only one server through the API, drained it, and then removed it, we now have an empty pool again.


    8.2 Seamless Reload

    + Problem :
    You need to reload you configuration without dropping packets.

    + Solution :
    Use the reload method of NGINX to achieve a seamless reload of the configuration without stopping the server:
    service nginx reload
    The command-line example reloads the NGINX system using the
    NGINX init script generally located in the /etc/init.d/ directory.

    8.3 SRV Records Problem
        You’d like to use your existing DNS SRV record implementation as the source for upstream servers.
        Solution
        Specify the service directive with a value of http on an upstream server to instruct NGINX to utilize
        the SRV record as a load- balancing pool:
        http {
            resolver 10.0.0.2;
            upstream backend {
            zone backends 64k;
            server api.example.internal service=http resolve;
        }
    }


    The configuration instructs NGINX to resolve DNS from a DNS server at 10.0.0.2 and set up an upstream server pool
    with a single server directive. This server directive specified with the resolve parameter is instructed to periodically
    re-resolve the domain name. The service=http parameter and value tells NGINX that this is an SRV record containing a list of IPs
    and ports and to load balance over them as if they were configured with the server directive.

    - Controlling Access :
    11.1 Access Based on IP Address

    + Problem :
    You need to control access based on the IP address of the client.

    + Solution :
    Use the HTTP access module to control access to protected resources:

    location /admin/ {
        deny 10.0.0.1;
        allow 10.0.0.0/20;
        allow 2001:0db8::/32;
        deny all;
    }

    ++ The given location block allows access from any IPv4 address in 10.0.0.0/20 except 10.0.0.1,
       allows access from IPv6 addresses in the 2001:0db8::/32 subnet, and returns a 403 for
       requests originating from any other address. The allow and deny directives are valid within the HTTP,
       server, and location contexts. Rules are checked in sequence until a match is found for the remote address.


    11.2 Allowing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

    + Problem :
    You’re serving resources from another domain and need to allow CORS to enable browsers to utilize these resources.

    + Solution :
    Alter headers based on the request method to enable CORS:
    map $request_method $cors_method {
        OPTIONS 11;
        GET 1;
        POST 1;
        default 0;
       }

    server {
        ...
        location / {
        if ($cors_method ~ '1') {
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET,POST,OPTIONS';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*.example.com';
            add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,
                                    Keep-Alive,
                                    User-Agent,
                                    X-Requested-With,
                                    If-Modified-Since,
                                    Cache-Control,
                                    Content-Type';
        if ($cors_method = '11') {
            add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' 1728000; add_header 'Content-Type' 'text/plain; charset=UTF-8';
            add_header 'Content-Length' 0;
            return 204;
                    }
          }

        }


    ++ There’s a lot going on in this example, which has been condensed by using a map to group the GET and POST methods together.
       The OPTIONS request method returns information called a preflight request to the client about this server’s CORS rules.
       OPTIONS, GET, and POST methods are allowed under CORS. Setting the Access- Control-Allow-Origin header allows
       for content being served from this server to also be used on pages of origins that match this header.
       The preflight request can be cached on the client for 1,728,000 sec‐ onds, or 20 days.
